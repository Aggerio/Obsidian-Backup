# NEVER EVER BREAK IMMMERSION !!!!!!

- Character consistency. 

## Bare Minimum

 - Put a story in , small context. --> 4000 words 
 -  End product, a fully illustrated book with images 

## Engineering standpoint --> 

- When splitting the page, shorten it using chatgpt and then fill in the prompt
- Prioritise API over self 
- Pseudo Scene generation --> 
	-  Find all the characters needing consistency in a scene 

### TODO

- For Image generation breaking can be done 2 ways --> pages(decided by the author) or we break it(chatgpt) -->  Test it out and vary on results 

### Legal Trouble Section --> 

- Adult scene restriction --> Should not restrict ? 
- Copyright 

## Go to market strategy?

## Task --> 

-  Diverse story for testing, the irony is real
